1. Configure PC bios

1.1 In your PC/Laptop/Server BIOS make sure the following is enabled in the BIOS:

            Intel VT-d & VT-x â€“ Intel Compatible list All AMD CPUs from Bulldozer onwards should be compatible.

2. Update Proxmox

2.1 Enable IOMMU in GRUB (check Intel or AMD commands below - choose the right one) nano /etc/default/grub

INTEL :          GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt"

AMD :            GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet amd_iommu=on"

Save and exit

2.2 run the command "update-grub" and then reboot proxmox

2.3 Verify that IOMMU is enabled by running dmesg | grep -e DMAR -e IOMMU and looking for a line indicating it is enabled

2.4 Enable VFIO Modules "nano /etc/modules" Add the following modules:

vfio
vfio_iommu_type1
vfio_pci
vfio_virqfd

Then, save and exit (X, Y, enter)

2.5 update-initramfs -u -k all and reboot proxmox

2.6 Verify the modules are enabled with dmesg | grep -i vfio and checking the driver version line is present

2.7 Get device IDs: lspci -nn

2.8 GPU Isolation From the Host (amend the below to include the IDs of the device you want to isolate)
 to get id's use the command lspci -n -s id (you should be enable to get the ids from the end of each entry from above) in 2.7


2.9 echo "options vfio-pci ids=10de:1381,10de:0fbc disable_vga=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf

2.10 Blacklist GPU drivers (here are all that you would ever need)

echo "blacklist radeon" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 
echo "blacklist nouveau" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 
echo "blacklist nvidia" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 
echo "blacklist nvidiafb" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
echo "blacklist nvidia_drm" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

Reboot your machine, be sure to use the web gui because with the gpu passed through you will no longer get video out. The start up will begin but then appear to hang even though proxmox has started fine.

Create a new VM and add the GPU via hardware menu You may need to set it as primary GPU You may need to add a ROM BAR
